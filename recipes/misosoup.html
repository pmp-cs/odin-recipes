        <p>Miso soup is the most famous Japanese soup. It is a very profound dish. It is easy to make, but requires a few tricks to make it delicious. Miso soup can be made into different flavors depending on the ingredients. Miso soup recipes range from simple to complex. The central ingredients of miso soup are miso, dashi and water. Miso comes in the yellow, aka (red) and shiro (white) varieties that are commonly found. Each type of miso has a different taste. If you are making miso soup for the first time, starting with yellow miso is the best. Dashi may not be found in some recipes, but to make a delicious miso soup, be sure to prepare dashi. For a simple version of dashi, use dashi granules as is, but for a more complex version, you can make it from scratch with bonito flakes, dried sardines, and other ingredients. If you are new to dashi, I recommend purchasing dashi granules. Other ingredients can be added as you like. This recipe is a version with the most standard Japanese ingredients.</p>
